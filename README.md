# LeetCode-Problems

Your favorite average man with no CS degree. Trying his best, solving & documenting his **COMPLETE** thought process, including its mistakes. Putting it in case you need some help or at least feel you're not alone ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜Š. The solutions for every problem is available in its folder, and the leetCode score for time & space performance is recorded for each problem.

Note: I sometimes solve medium and hard questions on paper first. I find it more comfortable to me to write down my though process on a paper than MD files, i apologies for that. I will do my best to document all the problems as much as possible.
